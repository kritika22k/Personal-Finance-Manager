The Flask Report Generator is a web-based application that allows users to dynamically generate reports. It follows best practices in modularization, abstraction, and object-oriented design while implementing error handling and input validation.

The system includes:

A Flask backend for handling user requests and generating reports.
A frontend (HTML, CSS) for user interaction.
A database (SQLite/PostgreSQL) for storing report data.
A testing suite to validate system functionality.
